	<h3>About Dufuna</h3> 
	<p>The advent of Dufuna-Fem Code Camp was inspired by the story of the discovery of the <em>Dufuna Canoe</em> for the first time. According to the founder,<blockquote>I am still thrilled by the achievement of the men and women who built the canoe 8,000 years ago. These unknown innovators saw a problem and applied their knowledge of maths, physics and materials to solve it. We don’t know who they were, how big their team was or how often they failed in the process.<br> All we know is that these unknown innovators built one of the oldest boats known to man before they came in contact with ‘civilisation’.</blockquote></p>


	Inspired by these <i>problem-solvers</i>, <a href="http://nigeria.ahk.de/">AHK Nigeria</a> initiated Dufuna-Fem Code Camp a Software Engineering Training Programme put together to discover <b>women</b> innovators in <strong>Nigeria</strong>.
